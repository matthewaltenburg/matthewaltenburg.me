Never interested in\n            stealing but in love with the puzzle of how things worked, in this\n            case, how this new computer was able to control the AT&T phone\n            exchanges. I used it to make free phone calls and to prank call the\n            White House. <br />\n            <br />\n            Unfortunately, not the wisest thing to do because back in the 80s,\n            there was an unreasonable fear of hacking. Because of this obsession\n            with my computers and the somewhat anti-social behaviour I was kept\n            away from any computers until early adulthood. <br /> <br />I was\n            kept busy with competitive swimming and became somewhat of a loner.\n            I think by today’s standers, I may have been diagnosed with\n            broad-spectrum autism. But at the time, it was classified as a\n            learning disability.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>\n          <p>\n            Towards the end of high school, it became pretty clear that I was\n            not naturally able to communicate or develop personal relationships\n            similar to other teenagers. <br />\n            <br />\n            Not wanting to be alone, I chose the most challenging career I could\n            imagine that would force me to develop communication skills, and\n            that was hairdressing. <br />\n            <br />\n            Hairdressing was not my passion. Science, math and computers were,\n            but I knew that I would find myself alone and lost in these fields.\n            Happy with what I was doing but unable to communicate effectively\n            with others. <br />\n            <br />\n            Because of my attention to detail and need to find patterns in what\n            I was doing, I became a very skilled hairdresser and started working\n            with the best hairdressers in the world, Vidal Sassoon, Toni and\n            Guy, Gram Webb, to name a few. My personality and personal skill\n            soon followed; although I was pretty awkward for the first few\n            years, nobody seemed to care as long as their hair looked good.{' '}\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            During this time is where I met my first wife and had kids, and\n            develop several friendships.\n          </p>\n          <h2>University</h2>\n          <p>\n            After about five years of hairdressing, and because I now felt that\n            I could communicate much better, I left and went to the University\n            of Central Florida to study Chemistry. <br />\n            <br />\n            Here is where I felt at home study Calculus, Physics and Chemistry.\n            I love the research and the community. I also started getting\n            involved with Linux and Programming again; all was good. <br />\n            <br />\n            But eventually, I graduated and could not afford to stay. I had a\n            family, responsibilities and started working in a Phosphate mine as\n            a chemist and a laboratory technician, which I found incredibly\n            dull.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Starting a Business</h2>\n          <p>\n            Needing new challenges and have two very different skillsets,\n            Chemistry and Hairdressing, I started my business specialing in hair\n            color. At first, it was just me and eventually a salon and a team.{' '}\n            <br /> <br />\n            I enjoyed this and the challenges it brought, but I found myself\n            programming the booking system, website, and server for fun. <br />\n            <br />\n            My love of computers and programming from my childhood had never\n            gone.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Change Careers and Skillsets</h2>\n          <p>\n            After more than 22 years working as a Chemist, Hairdresser, and\n            business owner, I started studying and working with computers,\n            drones and AI in 2012. <br />\n            <br />I didn’t go to school but instead sought out professors,\n            industry leaders, and people technology community meetups and talked\n            to them personally. I watched a lot of Youtube and read several\n            scientific papers. Practice coding in python, c++, and javascript\n            and revised my Linear Algebra and Calculus skills from my university\n            days. I learned how to use Matlab, bash, vim, and several other\n            tools. I did this because I had projects I wanted to work on.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Drones, Computer Vision and AI</h2>\n          <p>\n            This is where the fascination that I had with computers in 5th grade\n            bring me to where I am today. When I find myself working with\n            computers to control drones and teaching them to see. The main\n            projects I work on are ArduPilot, OpenCV and Pytorch.
