            “The best way to get to know someone is to take the time to
            understand their journey.”

          <h2>Here is mine.</h2>
          <p>
            Where I am today all started as a kid when in 5th grade I got my
            first computer which was a Commodore 64. Never interested in
            stealing but in love with the puzzle of how things worked, in this
            case, how this new computer was able to control the AT&T phone
            exchanges. I used it to make free phone calls and to prank call the
            White House. <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, not the wisest thing to do because back in the 80s,
            there was an unreasonable fear of hacking. Because of this obsession
            with my computers and the somewhat anti-social behaviour I was kept
            away from any computers until early adulthood. <br /> <br />I was
            kept busy with competitive swimming and became somewhat of a loner.
            I think by today’s standers, I may have been diagnosed with
            broad-spectrum autism. But at the time, it was classified as a
            learning disability.
          </p>
          <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
          <p>
            Towards the end of high school, it became pretty clear that I was
            not naturally able to communicate or develop personal relationships
            similar to other teenagers. <br />
            <br />
            Not wanting to be alone, I chose the most challenging career I could
            imagine that would force me to develop communication skills, and
            that was hairdressing. <br />
            <br />
            Hairdressing was not my passion. Science, math and computers were,
            but I knew that I would find myself alone and lost in these fields.
            Happy with what I was doing but unable to communicate effectively
            with others. <br />
            <br />
            Because of my attention to detail and need to find patterns in what
            I was doing, I became a very skilled hairdresser and started working
            with the best hairdressers in the world, Vidal Sassoon, Toni and
            Guy, Gram Webb, to name a few. My personality and personal skill
            soon followed; although I was pretty awkward for the first few
            years, nobody seemed to care as long as their hair looked good.{' '}
            <br />
            <br />
            During this time is where I met my first wife and had kids, and
            develop several friendships.
          </p>
          <h2>University</h2>
          <p>
            After about five years of hairdressing, and because I now felt that
            I could communicate much better, I left and went to the University
            of Central Florida to study Chemistry. <br />
            <br />
            Here is where I felt at home study Calculus, Physics and Chemistry.
            I love the research and the community. I also started getting
            involved with Linux and Programming again; all was good. <br />
            <br />
            But eventually, I graduated and could not afford to stay. I had a
            family, responsibilities and started working in a Phosphate mine as
            a chemist and a laboratory technician, which I found incredibly
            dull.
          </p>
          <h2>Starting a Business</h2>
          <p>
            Needing new challenges and have two very different skillsets,
            Chemistry and Hairdressing, I started my business specialing in hair
            color. At first, it was just me and eventually a salon and a team.{' '}
            <br /> <br />
            I enjoyed this and the challenges it brought, but I found myself
            programming the booking system, website, and server for fun. <br />
            <br />
            My love of computers and programming from my childhood had never
            gone.
          </p>
          <h2>Change Careers and Skillsets</h2>
          <p>
            After more than 22 years working as a Chemist, Hairdresser, and
            business owner, I started studying and working with computers,
            drones and AI in 2012. <br />
            <br />I didn’t go to school but instead sought out professors,
            industry leaders, and people technology community meetups and talked
            to them personally. I watched a lot of Youtube and read several
            scientific papers. Practice coding in python, c++, and javascript
            and revised my Linear Algebra and Calculus skills from my university
            days. I learned how to use Matlab, bash, vim, and several other
            tools. I did this because I had projects I wanted to work on.
          </p>
          <h2>Drones, Computer Vision and AI</h2>
          <p>
            This is where the fascination that I had with computers in 5th grade
            bring me to where I am today. When I find myself working with
            computers to control drones and teaching them to see. The main
            projects I work on are ArduPilot, OpenCV and Pytorch. To find out
            more please see my projects page.
